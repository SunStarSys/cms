# SunStar Systems CMS (Build Toolchain)

## Obsoleted Python-Markdown-based build system

### This includes mdx_elementid.py support.

## New build system is based on node.js and Editor.md: markdown.js!

### npm prerequisites: jquery, navigator, jsdom.

### markdown.js ENV VARS: NODE_PATH, EDITOR_MD, and MARKDOWN_SOCKET.

### Enjoy: no more deltas between online editor previews and build system markdown rendering
